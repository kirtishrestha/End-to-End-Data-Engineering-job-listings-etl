Role Overview

This is not an Executive Assistant role.

This is pivotal in the Founder’s Office, purpose-built for venture capital. You will own the coordination layer between the Founder, Principals, Associates, and deals in motion.

You Will
• Track deal progress, follow-ups, bottlenecks, and IC prep across the venture team
• Represent the Founder in meetings, review calls, and negotiations when required
• Manage internal execution hygiene: no drop-offs, no delays, no unforced errors
• Coordinate across LPs, legal, and internal teams to unblock high-priority workflows

This is a rare opportunity to operate as a force multiplier to the Managing Partner, with direct visibility into how fund-level decisions get made. This role offers a clear path for advancement, with the potential to transition into a Principal or higher position based on your performance over 2–3 years.

What You’ll Lead

• Prepare briefing notes, data sheets, and key context before every Founder meeting.
• Draft and refine notes, IC pre-reads, investor decks, and strategic updates

Cross-Team & External Coordination
• Act as the connective tissue between investment team, legal, fund ops, and external advisors
• Coordinate timelines, deliverables, and dependencies across stakeholders
• Ensure deal momentum is maintained—nothing falls through the cracks

Execution Hygiene & System Setup
• Own the deal tracking sheet, investment checklist, and calendar management systems.
• Standardize how tasks move from “discussion” to “done.”
• Bring visibility and structure to fast-moving, complex decision loops.

Who You Are
• A detail-obsessed VC professional who thrives on order, follow-through, and operational visibility
• 3–5 years in venture capital, private equity, or fund operations with direct exposure to deal execution
• Able to track multiple deals and people while pushing everything toward closure
• Comfortable representing the Managing Partner in meetings, follow-ups, and decisions
• Fast, structured, and calm under pressure—especially when chaos hits

Required Experience
• MBA or CA required. No exceptions.
• 3–5 years in VC/PE/fund investing or fund ops roles (deal-execution adjacent)
• Strong understanding of venture capital workflows: sourcing, diligence, IC, and legal
• Proven track record in execution, prioritization, and coordination roles
• Excellent writing skills: notes, memos, decks, and follow-ups must be sharp and founder-grade

Compensation Structure
• Total Annual Package - 26,50,000
• ₹20,00,000 fixed annual salary (paid monthly)
• ₹3,25,000 confirmed annual retention bonus (paid at the completion of 12 months)

• Ensure deal momentum is maintained—nothing falls through the cracks

Execution Hygiene & System Setup
• Own the deal tracking sheet, investment checklist, and calendar management systems.
• Standardize how tasks move from “discussion” to “done.”
• Bring visibility and structure to fast-moving, complex decision loops.

Who You Are
• A detail-obsessed VC professional who thrives on order, follow-through, and operational visibility
• 3–5 years in venture capital, private equity, or fund operations with direct exposure to deal execution
• Able to track multiple deals and people while pushing everything toward closure
• Comfortable representing the Managing Partner in meetings, follow-ups, and decisions
• Fast, structured, and calm under pressure—especially when chaos hits

Required Experience
• MBA or CA required. No exceptions.
• 3–5 years in VC/PE/fund investing or fund ops roles (deal-execution adjacent)
• Strong understanding of venture capital workflows: sourcing, diligence, IC, and legal
• Proven track record in execution, prioritization, and coordination roles
• Excellent writing skills: notes, memos, decks, and follow-ups must be sharp and founder-grade

This is not an Executive Assistant role.

• Represent the Founder in meetings, review calls, and negotiations when required

Cross-Team & External Coordination
• Act as the connective tissue between investment team, legal, fund ops, and external advisors
• Coordinate timelines, deliverables, and dependencies across stakeholders
• Ensure deal momentum is maintained—nothing falls through the cracks

Execution Hygiene & System Setup
• Own the deal tracking sheet, investment checklist, and calendar management systems.
• Standardize how tasks move from “discussion” to “done.”
• Bring visibility and structure to fast-moving, complex decision loops.

Who You Are
• A detail-obsessed VC professional who thrives on order, follow-through, and operational visibility
• 3–5 years in venture capital, private equity, or fund operations with direct exposure to deal execution
• Able to track multiple deals and people while pushing everything toward closure
• Comfortable representing the Managing Partner in meetings, follow-ups, and decisions
• Fast, structured, and calm under pressure—especially when chaos hits

Required Experience
• MBA or CA required. No exceptions.
• 3–5 years in VC/PE/fund investing or fund ops roles (deal-execution adjacent)
• Strong understanding of venture capital workflows: sourcing, diligence, IC, and legal
• Proven track record in execution, prioritization, and coordination roles
• Excellent writing skills: notes, memos, decks, and follow-ups must be sharp and founder-grade

Compensation Structure
• Total Annual Package - 26,50,000
• ₹20,00,000 fixed annual salary (paid monthly)

The Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment (ATREE) is a non-profit organisation focused on rigorous interdisciplinary knowledge generation for use by policy and practice, towards environmental conservation and sustainable, socially just development.

In the Himalaya, ATREE’s strategy is to work towards a future where resilient mountain and downstream societies sustainably enjoy the natural endowment of the Indian Himalayan Region (IHR) while protecting and preserving its rich biodiversity. ATREE has developed a 10-year strategy called “The Himalaya Initiative (THI)” with its focus in the IHR in the face of increasing biodiversity loss, environmental degradation, and climate change impacting the region.

Project AMP-Himalaya is backed by funding support from donors for the 5-year project period.

The Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment (ATREE) is a non-profit organisation focused on rigorous interdisciplinary knowledge generation for use by policy and practice, towards environmental conservation and sustainable, socially just development.

In the Himalaya, ATREE’s strategy is to work towards a future where resilient mountain and downstream societies sustainably enjoy the natural endowment of the Indian Himalayan Region (IHR) while protecting and preserving its rich biodiversity. ATREE has developed a 10-year strategy called “The Himalaya Initiative (THI)” with its focus in the IHR in the face of increasing biodiversity loss, environmental degradation, and climate change impacting the region.

"Уборка корпусов в лагерь ""Ахтуба кэмп""","ООО ""ИНТЕГРАЛ""",Авито,Полная занятость,"Здравствуйте!

В период летнего лагерного сезона, когда вся система детского отдыха нуждается в надёжной, чистой, честной и организованной работе, обращаюсь к вам — трудолюбивым, вдумчивым, желающим принести пользу делу воспитания подрастающего поколения.

Детский лагерь в Средней Ахтубе, расположенный вблизи Волжского, объявляет набор двух горничных (уборщиц), готовых трудиться в условиях высокой общественной значимости выполняемого ими труда.

Мы предоставим вам:

🔹 Проживание в отдельной комнате на территории лагеря;
🔹 Полноценное питание — 3 раза в день;
🔹 Человеческие условия: интернет, библиотека, прачечная, прохладный сосновый воздух, тишина природы, река, пляж.

У нас — не промзона и не городской двор. У нас — среда, где каждый знает, зачем он здесь.

Трудовой график: 6/1 или 14/3 — по согласованию с руководством. Проживание на территории обязательно, это особенность нашей сферы деятельности, с которой ничего не поделаешь.

Особое внимание:
Если у вас есть ребёнок — мы не только не мешаем, но поможем.

✅ Ваш ребёнок сможет пройти летнюю программу лагеря наравне с другими детьми — без дополнительной оплаты.

Таким образом, мать не отделяется от ребёнка, а трудится в его присутствии, имея возможность видеть, как растёт, общается и развивается её сын или дочь/внуки.

"Уборка корпусов в лагерь ""Ахтуба кэмп""","ООО ""ИНТЕГРАЛ""",Авито,Полная занятость,"Здравствуйте!

В период летнего лагерного сезона, когда вся система детского отдыха нуждается в надёжной, чистой, честной и организованной работе, обращаюсь к вам — трудолюбивым, вдумчивым, желающим принести пользу делу воспитания подрастающего поколения.

Детский лагерь в Средней Ахтубе, расположенный вблизи Волжского, объявляет набор двух горничных (уборщиц), готовых трудиться в условиях высокой общественной значимости выполняемого ими труда.

Мы предоставим вам:

🔹 Проживание в отдельной комнате на территории лагеря;
🔹 Полноценное питание — 3 раза в день;
🔹 Человеческие условия: интернет, библиотека, прачечная, прохладный сосновый воздух, тишина природы, река, пляж.

У нас — не промзона и не городской двор. У нас — среда, где каждый знает, зачем он здесь.

Трудовой график: 6/1 или 14/3 — по согласованию с руководством. Проживание на территории обязательно, это особенность нашей сферы деятельности, с которой ничего не поделаешь.

Особое внимание:
Если у вас есть ребёнок — мы не только не мешаем, но поможем.

✅ Ваш ребёнок сможет пройти летнюю программу лагеря наравне с другими детьми — без дополнительной оплаты.

Таким образом, мать не отделяется от ребёнка, а трудится в его присутствии, имея возможность видеть, как растёт, общается и развивается её сын или дочь/внуки.

📌 Что потребуется от вас:

— подготовка корпуса к заезду детей (после косметического ремонта);;
— поддержание санитарных норм в помещениях, включая мойку полов, туалетов, поверхностей, окон.

Заработная плата:

💰 1300 руб. в день — окладная часть;
💰 200 руб. премия — при надлежащем исполнении (по итогам смены, каждые 2 недели);
Итого 1500р/день

📅 Выплаты своевременно, в полном объёме, в соответствии с установленными нормами и утверждённой ставкой.

Труд сезонный, но возможна работа на постоянной основе — наш лагерь функционирует круглогодично.

Мы не обещаем лёгкой прогулки.
Но мы гарантируем: уважение, коллектив, честную оплату, условия, в которых человек чувствует себя нужным.

Кто готов встать в строй и внести вклад в большое общее дело — оставьте отклик и номер телефона.

Я или мой помощник обязательно свяжемся с вами в течение дня. Прошу — не звоните сами.

Александр Борисович
